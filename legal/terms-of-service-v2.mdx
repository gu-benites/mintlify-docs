## AGREEMENT TO OUR LEGAL TERMS

We are {companyName}, doing business as {companyBusinessName} ("**Company**," "**we**," "**us**," "**our**"), a company registered in {companyCountry} at {companyAddress}.

We operate the website [{websiteUrl}]({websiteUrl}) (the "**Site**"), the mobile application {appName} (the "**App**"), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the "**Legal Terms**") (collectively, the "**Services**").

You can contact us by phone at {companyPhone}, email at {companyEmail}, or by mail to {companyAddress}.

These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("**you**"), and {companyName}, concerning your access to and use of the Services. You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

We will provide you with prior notice of any scheduled changes to the Services you are using. Changes to these Legal Terms will become effective seven (7) days after the notice is given, except if the changes apply to new functionality, security updates, bug fixes, and a court order, in which case the changes will be effective immediately. By continuing to use the Services after the effective date of any changes, you agree to be bound by the modified terms. If you disagree with such changes, you may terminate Services as per the section "TERM AND TERMINATION."

The Services are intended for users who are at least 18 years old. Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to use or register for the Services.

We recommend that you print a copy of these Legal Terms for your records.

## 1. OUR SERVICES

The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
