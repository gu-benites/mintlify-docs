## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
    
    To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Start the preview server">
    1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
    2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`
    3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live!
    
    <Tip>Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Install our GitHub app">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).
    
    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="palette" title="Update your site name and colors">
    For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

    1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
    2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
    3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
    4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

    <Tip>Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Go live

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Publish your docs">
  1. Commit and push your changes.
  2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!
</Accordion>

## Next steps

Now that you have your docs running, explore these key features:

## Titles

Best used for section headers.

```md
## Titles
```

### Subtitles

Best used for subsection headers.

```md
### Subtitles
```

<Tip>

Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of contents on the right.

</Tip>

## Text formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.

| Style         | How to write it   | Result          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Linking to pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/writing-content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

## Blockquotes

### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multiline

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

### LaTeX

Mintlify supports [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) through the Latex component.

<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>

```md
<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>
```

The navigation menu is the list of links on every website.

You will likely update `docs.json` every time you add a new page. Pages do not show up automatically.

## Navigation syntax

Our navigation syntax is recursive which means you can make nested navigation groups. You don't need to include `.mdx` in page names.

<CodeGroup>

```json Regular Navigation
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Getting Started",
          "pages": ["quickstart"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

```json Nested Navigation
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Getting Started",
          "pages": [
            "quickstart",
            {
              "group": "Nested Reference Pages",
              "pages": ["nested-reference-page"]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Folders

Simply put your MDX files in folders and update the paths in `docs.json`.

For example, to have a page at `https://yoursite.com/your-folder/your-page` you would make a folder called `your-folder` containing an MDX file called `your-page.mdx`.

<Warning>

You cannot use `api` for the name of a folder unless you nest it inside another folder. Mintlify uses Next.js which reserves the top-level `api` folder for internal server calls. A folder name such as `api-reference` would be accepted.

</Warning>

```json Navigation With Folder
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Group Name",
          "pages": ["your-folder/your-page"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Hidden pages

MDX files not included in `docs.json` will not show up in the sidebar but are accessible through the search bar and by linking directly to them.

## Endpoint

```http
GET /api/items
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Required | Description                    |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------------------------------|
| limit     | number | No       | Maximum number of items to return |
| offset    | number | No       | Number of items to skip        |

## Response

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Example Item",
      "description": "This is an example item"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```
<Note>
  If you're not looking to build API reference documentation, you can delete
  this section by removing the api-reference folder.
</Note>

## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). This starter shows examples using MDX components.

## Authentication

API endpoints can be authenticated using various methods such as Bearer tokens, API keys, or OAuth.

```json
"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```
