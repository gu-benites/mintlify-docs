## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). This starter shows examples using MDX components.

## Authentication

API endpoints can be authenticated using various methods such as Bearer tokens, API keys, or OAuth.

```json
"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```
